# Maze_Solver_Unified
Image processes a maze, solves it and then creates a png file with the solution.

Can download any orthogonal square maze with default settings from mazegenerator.com in png form and feed it to the program, it will solve it and show you the paths it has taken until it reaches the endpoint.

New version also finds optimal path using A* pathfinding algorithm.

Only the filepath of the png file needs be modified in the code for it to run.
